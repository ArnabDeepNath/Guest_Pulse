GuestPulse LIVE: In-Stay Real-Time Guest
Feedback System

Job Overview:

We’re developing a mobile-friendly, branded in-stay
guest feedback form that hotels can display via QR
code in guest rooms. The system allows guests to
discreetly report issues while still on property, with
real-time alerts going to hotel staff if something is
wrong - helping resolve concerns before they turn
into bad online reviews.

Project Goals:

Create a smooth mobile-first guest feedback form
with logic-based questions.

Allow private issue reporting during the stay.

Trigger instant alerts to hotel staff when negative
feedback is received.

Provide an easily editable template for future hotel
clients.

Include a how-to guide for staff or other freelancers to
duplicate and rebrand the system.
